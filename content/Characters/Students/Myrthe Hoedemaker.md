# History
- She grew up in Antwerp and was homeschooled by her dad whilst she lived there.
- Her mother died when she was four, so she does not remember her.
- Her father decided to move them to Australia because he wanted to start them afresh and wanted to do it far away from Belgium so that they could easily have a good start. (He also started helping Myrthe learn English when she was in around Year 9.)
- She began her time at Kalamunda Sapling School midway through Year 10.
- She lives with her dad, Robrecht, in Forrestfield, and they are quite close.
- She is introduced in Chapter 18.

# Current Day
 She takes the following subjects at [Kalamunda Sapling School](<Kalamunda Sapling School>):
 - Italian (which she takes alongside [[Roosje Alderliesten]], who often peer-marks her written tests.)
 - Drama (She is in the same class as [[Fernanda Grillo]].)
 - English Lit (She is in [[Roosje Alderliesten]]'s class)
 - Foods
 - Maths
 - Psychology

# Relationships
## Roosje
- Myrthe initially became acquainted with [[Roosje Alderliesten]] during Chapter 14 (off-screen). They became friends in English class by trying to play a Word Chain game in Dutch. ([[Roosje Alderliesten]] won, by the way).
- They became closer in the school holidays, during which they had many sleepovers at Myrthe's place.
- In Chapter 31, Myrthe planned to confess romantic feelings for her by sharing the crab dish Roosje ordered. However, Roosje confessed first and they officially became a couple.

## Fernanda
- She and [[Fernanda Grillo]] befriended one another when they were assigned to work in a group for an assessment in Drama class off-screen during Chapter 25.
- Myrthe really likes Fernanda's fashion sense and overwhelms her with compliments, not seeming to care she wears the same thing every day.
- In a side story before the events of Chapter 31, Myrthe, Roosje, and Fernanda all go to the dinner dance together in Myrthe's dad's car. Myrthe promises to teach her a "way cool" dance move.

## Altair
- She was introduced to [[Altair Vilar-Castelo]] upon him bringing Fernanda to her Drama class from the Art block.
- They are just acquaintances at the moment.

## Vake (Robrecht)
- She is really close with her dad.
- She really likes it when he makes spicy curries for her and has a high spice tolerance because of it.
- She watches old Flemish soap operas with him on Saturday afternoons.

## Fiadh
- She met Fiadh during Chapter 18 whilst styling Roosje's hair.
- Fiadh helped her find a hair-dryer.
- She and Fiadh are similarly energetic, and she likes to try hanging out with her during rehearsals for the Production.

## Zelda
- She likes Zelda.
- She wants to get to know her a bit better.

## Alice
- She praises Alice's dress in Chapter 31 out of nervousness due to overthinking, however, she does genuinely like Alice's dress.
- She wants to go shopping with her sometime.

## Ash
- Ash actually scares her a little bit.
- She does like the sort of music he plays on his guitar, though, and will be close behind Harper to watch him play. (For different reasons, obviously.)

## Harper
- She likes Harper.
- The two share a mutual fascination for Ash's guitar skills, except Myrthe makes it clear to Harper from day one that they are not rivals and that they look up to Ash for drastically different reasons.

## Sheila
- Their dads work at the same Bunnings, so when she gets the chance, she likes to compare the stories the two's dads give them about their work days.
- She sometimes likes to note down the slang Sheila uses, but never uses it herself.
- She gets along decently with Sheila. (After all, she is one of her best friends' besties, so she can't be terrible.)

# Other
-  Speaks like a stereotypical 1950s American teen when she's nervous.
- Obsessed with fashion.
- She dresses (at least, for casual events) like Joan Jett.
- Her general fashion sense leans heavily on 1970s-80s aesthetics.
- She HATES wearing school uniform and has gotten at least 6 tickets within one term for uniform infringements.
- She often substitutes the Flemish word for an item when she doesn't yet know the English name of. (Like in Chapter 18.)
- She hates brushing her hair, but does it anyway because she looks tidy. By her next appearance after Chapter 18, she has officially cut her hair short and started brushing it.
- She always reminds Roosje of one of Roosje's mothers being a model for '50s fashion, much to the latter's annoyance.

# History
- She and her sister lived in Swifterbant in the Netherlands for a while until Marjolijn wanted to move abroad to study for uni. She took Roosje to Australia with her, and they have been living in Australia ever since.
- She and her sister were raised by their two mums, one of whom was a model and the other of whom worked at the bank.
- Upon moving to Australia, there were two locations they were going to pick from, however since one location took longer to get from there to the local school, they wound up choosing Kalamunda.
- She started at Kalamunda Sapling School when she was in Year 9, but only made her first proper friends in Year 11.
- She is introduced in Chapter 14 during the Drama lesson segment, in which she both befriends Fiadh and Zelda *and* eats a lot of herring.

## Current Day
- She now lives in an apartment in Kalamunda which her and her sister live in together.
- She takes the following subjects at Kalamunda Sapling School: 
                         -  English Literature
                          -  Drama
                          - Italian 
                          - History
                          - Integrated Science
                          - Media


# Relationships
## Marjolijn (sister)
- She and her sister get along well, however her more formal style of speech clashes a lot with her sister's more casual manner of speech.
- Marjolijn is also often busy clubbing, working, or (at least in Chasing Hearts) studying at uni to spend much time with her, often leaving Roosje home by herself, which isn't very good.
- Occasionally, they watch old Dutch anime dubs together on Marjolijn's laptop.

## Myrthe
- She befriends [[Myrthe Hoedemaker]] off-screen in Chapter 14 when the two play a word chain game together. She agrees to become friends with her only after beating her easily. (They got an impressive 50 words in before Myrthe was finally beaten).
- They had a lot of sleepovers together during the school holidays, which resulted in them becoming better friends.
- She confessed her romantic feelings for Myrthe (after a lot of encouragement from Fiadh and a cupcake she ate for courage given by Ms Chiba) in Chapter 31.

## Fernanda
- She became acquainted with [[Fernanda Grillo]] when she was introduced to the whole group in Chapter 25.
- She is often the one to watch over her when she randomly goes swimming in the mornings and cheers her on at swimming carnivals.
- She saw one of Fernanda's sisters at the shops and had to wait outside with her for Fernanda and the rest of Fernanda's family to come back. After this, Fernanda has been really friendly with Roosje, occasionally following her around when she has a different class on.

## Altair
- She met [[Altair Vilar-Castelo]] during production rehearsals one day, when Fernanda snuck in because of getting lost on the way to the carpark.
- Eventually she just wound up letting the two come watch rehearsals after obtaining permission from one of the teachers in charge.
- She and him occasionally buy books together when she, Fernanda, Myrthe, and he go out to the shops as a group.

## Zelda

- She and Zelda became close in Chapter 16, upon realising just how much they have in common.
- Apart from Myrthe, Zelda is now the main person Roosje talks to when the group is all together at breaktimes.

## Fiadh
- She likes Fiadh but also finds her to just be A LOT.
- During Chapter 16, she gives Fiadh some clothes she sewed for her with a heartfelt card attached, saying how grateful she is for their friendship.
- She also asks Fiadh for love advice in Chapter 31, very confused by her rhyming advice but ultimately taking it and confessing to Myrthe.

## Sheila
- When Sheila uses Australian slang, it confuses her a little.
- When Fernanda was asked who she liked by both Sheila and Fiadh, Roosje and Myrthe both tried to get her off her back.
- She is otherwise amicable with Sheila and likes her. When Sheila and Altair become a romantic pair in Chapter 31, she is happy for them both.

## Alice
- She gets along with Alice.
- She often sews Alice femme clothing in her spare time and asks her what sorts of clothes she likes to wear so she sews her only things she will want to wear.

## Ash
- Ash scares her a lot and his laid-back nature sort of irritates her.
- She is a bit jealous of how laid-back they can be and wonders how they don't seem to worry about anything at all.

## Harper
- She wants to get to know Harper better.
- There are a few times where Harper has helped her in Drama class, and due to this, she considers Harper a good friend of hers.
- She gets along well with her.


# Other
  - Has a stilted and overly formal style of speech and struggles to talk to others.
  - Very shy and has a stutter.
  - Has a spinal condition (spina bifida) which results in her using a wheelchair to get around.
  - Her favourite food of all time is *maatjesharing*.
  - One of her mothers is a famous model. She has two mothers.
